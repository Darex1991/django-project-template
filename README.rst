Django Project Template
=======================

This repository aims to kickstart a fully fledged Django project within
seconds. 

This script has been created to accompany a 3.5 hour tutorial which was
presented at PyCon Singapore 2013. You can find slides with step by step
instructions here: https://speakerdeck.com/mbrochh/hosting-complex-web-applications-on-webfaction-servers

* The project will be ready for test driven develpment
* It has an extensive fabfile for automated deployments and continuous testing
* It is structured and configured to be hosted on Webfaction servers
* It uses a rapid prototyping view which allows your designers to start working
  on the new project immediately, even though no urls, models or views have 
  been implemented, yet
